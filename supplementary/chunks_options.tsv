name	value	type	description
child	NULL	code_evaluation	A character vector of filenames. Knitr will knit the files and place them into the main document.
code	NULL	code_evaluation	Set to R code. Knitr will replace the code in the chunk with the code in the code option.
engine	'R'	code_evaluation	Knitr will evaluate the chunk in the named language, e.g. engine = 'python'. Run names(knitr::knit_engines$get()) to see supported languages.
eval	TRUE	code_evaluation	If FALSE, knitr will not run the code in the code chunk.
include	TRUE	code_evaluation	If FALSE, knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.
purl	TRUE	code_evaluation	If FALSE, knitr will not include the chunk when running purl() to extract the source code.
collapse	FALSE	results	If TRUE, knitr will collapse all the source and output blocks created by the chunk into a single block.
echo	TRUE	results	If FALSE, knitr will not display the code in the code chunk above it’s results in the final document.
results	'markup'	results	If 'hide', knitr will not display the code’s results in the final document. If 'hold',knitr will delay displaying all output pieces until the end of the chunk. If 'asis',knitr will pass through results without reformatting them (useful if results return raw HTML,etc.)
error	TRUE	results	If FALSE, knitr will not display any error messages generated by the code.
message	TRUE	results	If FALSE, knitr will not display any messages generated by the code.
warning	TRUE	results	If FALSE, knitr will not display any warning messages generated by the code.
comment	'##'	code_decoration	A character string. Knitr will append the string to the start of each line of results in the final document.
highlight	TRUE	code_decoration	If TRUE, knitr will highlight the source code in the final output.
prompt	FALSE	code_decoration	If TRUE, knitr will add > to the start of each line of code displayed in the final document.
strip.white	TRUE	code_decoration	If TRUE, knitr will remove white spaces that appear at the beginning or end of a code chunk.
tidy	FALSE	code_decoration	If TRUE, knitr will tidy code chunks for display with the tidy_source() function in the formatR package.
opts.label	NULL	chunks	The label of options set in knitr:: opts_template() to use with the chunk.
R.options	NULL	chunks	Local R options to use with the chunk. Options are set with options() at start of chunk. Defaults are restored at end.
ref.label	NULL	chunks	A character vector of labels of the chunks from which the code of the current chunk is inherited.
autodep	FALSE	cache	If TRUE, knitr will attempt to figure out dependencies between chunks automatically by analyzing object names.
cache	FALSE	cache	If TRUE, knitr will cache the results to reuse in future knits. Knitr will reuse the results until the code chunk is altered.
cache.comments	NULL	cache	If FALSE, knitr will not rerun the chunk if only a code comment has changed.
cache.lazy	TRUE	cache	If TRUE, knitr will use lazyload() to load objects in chunk. If FALSE, knitr will use load() to load objects in chunk.
cache.path	'cache/'	cache	cache.vars NULL A character vector of object names to cache if you do not wish to cache each object in the chunk.
dependson	NULL	cache	A character vector of chunk labels to s
dev	'png'	plots	The R function name that will be used as a graphical device to record plots, e.g. dev='CairoPDF'.
dev.args	NULL	plots	Arguments to be passed to the device, e.g. dev.args=list(bg='yellow', pointsize=10).
dpi	72	plots	A number for knitr to use as the dots per inch (dpi) in graphics (when applicable).
external	TRUE	plots	If TRUE, knitr will externalize tikz graphics to save LaTex compilation time (only for the tikzDevice::tikz() device).
fig.align	'default'	plots	How to align graphics in the final document. One of 'left', 'right', or 'center'.
fig.cap	NULL	plots	A character string to be used as a figure caption in LaTex.
fig.env	'figure'	plots	The Latex environment for figures.
fig.ext	NULL	plots	The file extension for figure output, e.g. fig.ext='png'.
fig.height	7	plots	The height to use in R for plots created by the chunk (in inches).
fig.width	7	plots	The width to use in R for plots created by the chunk (in inches).
fig.keep	'high'	plots	If 'high', knitr will merge low-level changes into high level plots. If 'all', knitr will keep all plots (low-level changes may produce new plots). If 'first', knitr will keep the first plot only. If 'last', knitr will keep the last plot only. If 'none', knitr will discard all plots.
fig.lp	'fig:'	plots	A prefix to be used for figure labels in latex.
fig.path	figure/'	plots	fig.pos '' fig.process NULL fig.retina 1 fig.scap NULL A character string to be used as a short figure caption.
fig.subcap	NULL	plots	A character string to be used as captions in sub-figures in LaTex.
fig.show	'asis'	plots	If 'hide', knitr will generate the plots created in the chunk, but not include them in the final document. If 'hold', knitr will delay displaying the plots created by the chunk until the end of the chunk. If 'animate', knitr will combine all of the plots created by the chunk into an animation.
fig.showtext	NULL	plots	If TRUE, knitr will call showtext::showtext.begin() before drawing plots.
out.extra	NULL	plots	A character string of extra options for figures to be passed to LaTex or HTML.
out.height	NULL	plots	The height and height to scale plots to in the final output. Can be in units recognized by output, e.g. 8\\linewidth, 50px
out.width	NULL	plots	The width and height to scale plots to in the final output. Can be in units recognized by output, e.g. 8\\linewidth, 50px
resize.height	NULL	plots	The height and height to resize tike graphics in LaTex, passed to \resizebox{}{}.
resize.width	NULL	plots	The width and height to resize tike graphics in LaTex, passed to \resizebox{}{}.
sanitize	FALSE	plots	If TRUE, knitr will sanitize tike graphics for LaTex.
