# Git introduction

[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) is one of many tool, but very popular, that was desing for **tracking versions** of software development - a.k.a version control tool. While it hasn't been strickly design with scientific research projects in mind we will happily repurpose git to help us stay on top of our research projects. Git will help us:

- organise our directory structure
- create "milestones" a.k.a `git commits`
- make apparent which parts of the projects (files) are important
- git will also help us to share our work
- and last but not least git will help us collaborate

```

Git is a command line tool however you don't have to learn command line just yet. There are a [few git clients available](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html) - graphical user interface (GUI) tool / applicatons that we can use instead of learning command line. We are going to use RStudio which has good git support and therefore Rstudio will be our git client. One rather important note about git clients, most (all) clients will "simply" form a git commands as you would type it out and execute on command line. This means a couple of things:

1. one can use mixture of clients and command line without any issues. For example if one needs more complicated git command one could run it on the command-line.
2. if you need to do a more complicated git kung fu you might only find solution for command line and then it'll be up to you to figure out how to work it into your client

An interesting note about command line git usage noted in [Happy Git with R book](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html); One might think that git via cli is "better", however it is more important to get the work done and have it version controlled rather then fight with the cli. Do take the simplest and quickest path to get your work version controlled. No one will care which client you are using in the end.

## git no nos

- no spaces in file names (this goes beyond git)
- no git repositories inside an existing git repository

## Starting with git

In Rstudio you can only start working with git when you have an existing Rproject directory

```{r echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-cloud6.png")
```

### Configuring git

You will most certainly forget this step, because you only need to do it once per computer (or new installation of git). Git will remind if you haven't done these steps.
These are our very first step in being organise and ready for future collaboration. We need to let git know our name and email address, which will get stored in configuration file.

Unfortuntally RStudio doesn't have support for setting up config. It was probably not worth implementing given that you only really do it once.

```
git config --global user.name kirill
git config --global user.name "kirill.tsyganov@monash.edu"
```

One can then double check that all was set correctly bu running this command.

```
git config --global --list
```

### Intiating git repository

In git jargon repository is simply your working folder (folders sometimes also called directories). In our case

`Rproject folder == Rproject directory == git repository == git repo`

```{r echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-cloud6.png")
```

git init
git config

Tools -> Version Control -> Project Setup -> Git/SVN
Tools -> Global Options -> Git/SVN

make a diagram where git at the center and arrows out to different places gitlab, github, bitbucket personal server, even the same comoputer but different "bare" folder (this isnt "safe" nor accessible by others, but totaly possible)


section 10 from that article is awesome, include most of it

briefly talk about github things like PR, gitissues, staring and watching projects, collaborators and update dates/commits as a proxy of how active the project is. also do check which files typically being changed. Also mention the fact that it is very explicit when the project was started (initiated) how much work has gone into it (commits history) and roughly time frame and intervals of work

rock climbing analogy is awesome to how important git commits are - do set your anchors often

mention at some point README file as a general means of "silent"  communication then README.md and index.html as "special" files. README.md is the front page - apperance for your project. One can have multiple README.md files in subdirectories if necessary.


in simple workflow and collaborations git merge will work just fine. git will happy merge two different branches i.e all files in one location with all files in the other location if no two file conflict
