# Vanilla Markdown

The original (vanilla) version of Markdown invented by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) defines a handful of tags, [discussed next](#vanilla-tags). Markdown is relatively small and simple language for writing plain text documents. It is entirely comprised out of punctuation characters. The goal of markdown is that it is easy-to-write and easy-to-read. Markdown has been greatly enhanced and extended by pandoc tool.

## Vanilla tags

Let's open our first Markdown file.

```
File
 └── New File
        └── R Markdown

title = "Learning Markdown"
author = "Me"
```

- select document type **HTML**
- to build (compile) the document by press `knitr` button or `ctrl+alt+k`
- save file by pressing `ctrl^S` and name the files `learning_markdown.Rmd`

Since we are using RStudio and R it is inevitable that will be using Rmarkdown flaour, but we can still write only vanilla markdown and remember that under the hood Rmarkdown will always be converted to vanilla markdown.

From now onward we are going to start using `knitr` to complie Rmarkdown into html. Remember from the [Rmarkdown ecosystem]() that `knitr` will convert Rmarkdown to markdonw and `rmarkdown` R package will convert - render markdown file into html. By pressing that blue button both things will happen automatically and we don't need to think about, but I wanted you to know that.

These are essintially all core (vanilla) markdown tags. Let's practice writting them in the [next section](#practice-vanilla-markdown).

```
# Header1
## Header2
### Header3

Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

Two spaces at the end of a line
produces a line break.

Text attributes _italic_,
**bold**, `monospace`.

Horizontal rule:

---

Bullet list:

  * apples
  * oranges
  * pears

Numbered list:

  1. wash
  2. rinse
  3. repeat

A [link](http://example.com).

> Markdown uses email-style
> characters for blockquoting.
```

## Practice vanilla markdown

Now it's just a matter of learning some of the markdown syntax. Let's delete all current text from the opened document except the YAML header and type this new text in `Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !` and pressing the `knit HTML` button.

```
Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
```

Not much happened. This is because we didn't mark our text in any way. You can put as much text as you want and it will appear as is, unless "specially" marked to look differently.

Now add the `#` symbol at the start of the line and press the `knit HTML` button again. We'll be pressing this button a lot! For those who like keyboard short cuts use `ctrl+shift+k` instead.

```
# Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
```

How about now? A single hash symbol made it whole lot bigger didn't it? We've marked this whole line to be the header line.

Now make three new lines with the same text, but different numbers of `#` symbols, one, two and three respectively and keep pressing the `Knit HTML` button


```
# Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
## Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
### Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
```

This is how you can specify different headers type using markdown.

Let's now practice making very short document in markdown with a main topic section and two subsections. We will add short sentences in each section. We will start with main section header and a quote. Let's type the following text and `knit` our document.

```
# Learning Markdown

> I'm still learning
```

Now let's add three bullet points summarising what we are going to learn next and then `knit` the document again.

```
# Learning Markdown

> I'm still learning

Here I'll be learning:

- markdown
- Rmarkdown
- git and github
```

Now let's add each one of those bullet items as a subsection to the main "Learning Markdown" section.We are going to use `##` to mark subsections and don't forget to `knit` again.

```
# Learning Markdown

> I'm still learning

Here I'll be learning:

- markdown
- Rmarkdown
- git and github

## Markdown

## Rmarkdown

## Git and GitHub
```

Now let's add a sentence to each section, briefly describing what they are.

```
# Learning Markdown

> I'm still learning

Here I'll be learning:

- markdown
- Rmarkdown
- git and github

## Markdown

Here I'll learng vanilla markdown

## Rmarkdown

Whereas here I'll be learning Rmarkdown

## Git and GitHub

And this section is scary
```

Let's add a emphasis to some of the words in our document. We are going to add _italic_ emphasis to the word "vanilla" and we are going to add **bold** emphasis to the capital letter "R" in the word Rmarkdown. You'll need to `knit` your document still.

```
# Learning Markdown

> I'm still learning

Here I'll be learning:

- markdown
- Rmarkdown
- git and github

## Markdown

Here I'll learng _vanilla_ markdown

## Rmarkdown

Whereas here I'll be learning **R**markdown

## Git and GitHub

And this section is scary

    2. Can markdown replace [html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (discussion question)?
  </summary>
  It has replaced html and latex in documentation and communication of results space. My feeling is that data science ecosystem heavily rotates around markdown. But html, pdf and latex in this context are "simply" communication and sharing medium.
  It would be very difficult to replace html + css for larger ("proper") website project.

Let's learn how to add external and internal links to your document, remember the syntax for adding links is `[DESCRIPTION](link-address)`. The external link that we are going to add is going to be this [https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). Each one of the bullet points above going to become a link to it section. The way you reference internal section is by starting your address with a `#` symbol then simply using all lower case letters for the section name and all spaces need to be converted to a dash symbol `-`. Let's add those things in and re-build our document.

```
# Learning Markdown

- [git and github](#git-and-github)

```

A bonus exercise is to add logos to each sections. Search internet for:

- Markdown logo, and add the image using `![](link_address)` syntax
- RMarkdown logo, and add the image using `![](link_address)` syntax
- Git logo, and add the image using `![](link_address)` syntax
- GitHub logo, and add the image using `![](link_address)` syntax

Note for the external resource that is on internet the address must start with `www` or `https` otherwise address will be interpreted as file path.
